                <p>Hello and welcome to my webpage!</p>
                <p>I am currently a Quality Data and Applications Analyst for a hospital in Illinois just outside of St. Louis. Before that, I was a high school mathematics teacher for 3 years.
                    I have a background in both CS and mathematics, and have come on a full-circle computer science journey by redeveloping a passion for coding and analysis.</p>
                <p>As I've continued to build my skillset in data analytics and software development, I built this portfolio website as both an HTML/CSS exercise
                    as well as a place to store information on any projects I have worked on or am in the process of finishing. Feel free to browse and reach out if you have any questions!</p>
